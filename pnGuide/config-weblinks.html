>Web Links allow your users to submit, view, and comment on other websites. Web Links can be configured into categories (for example: "Computers") and sub-categories (for example, "Computers / Games", "Computers / Audio", or "Computers / CMS"). Users can search for results or post comments about websites within this module.

Simply type the title of the page (for example, "Official PostNuke Homepage"), the complete page URL (including "http://") (for example: "http://www.postnuke.com"), the category in which the page should appear on your site (for example, "Computers / CMS"), a free-form alphanumeric text description of the site (for example: "All things PostNuke!"), and finally, the username and email address of the submitter. Click "Add this URL" to add the new link. When logged in as the Administrator, the submission is added to the database immediately. If not logged in as the Administrator, links must be approved before they will be posted.

>Modify a Link: To modify a link, enter its "Link ID" in this field and click the "Modify" button. To determine a link's Link ID, locate the Web Link entry that you wish to edit and "hover" the mouse over the link title. In the browser's status bar, you will see the URL for the link, for example: http://www.yoursite.com/modules.php?op=modload&#38;name=Web_Links&#38;file=index&#38;req=visit&#38;lid=59. Look at the end of the line for "lid=##", where "##" is the Link ID. In this example, your Link ID is "59".
