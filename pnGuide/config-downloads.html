>Your website can offer files for users to download. These downloads may be broken into categories and sub-categories to make it easier for users to locate just the files in which they are interested. This section of configuration is where you specify options relating to Downloads. By default, Downloads is not active and must be activated through Administration -&#62; Modules.

>Validate downloads: This function can assist in determining which files in your downloads section are no longer valid. Click "Validate downloads" to be taken to a screen with several options. Click "Check ALL Downloads" to have PostNuke automatically check each and every download on your site. Please note that this function may take several moments to finish, especially if you have lots of downloadable files. If you wish to validate only a category (and its sub-categories) of downloads, click the name of the category that you wish to validate. If you wish to validate only a sub-category, click the name of the sub-category that you wish to validate.
