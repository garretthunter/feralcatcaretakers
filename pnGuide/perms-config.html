>Each user can be placed in a definable Group and the entire group can be given a permission set. If you are upgrading from an older version of PostNuke, PHPNuke, or myPHPNuke, you will have new Groups defined for each of the author permissions that you had previously defined. These groups are set up during the upgrade, but you will need to manually configure their permissions.

>IMPORTANT NOTE: It is critically important that the ORDER of the Groups is correct. Permissions are applied in order, from the top down. The system stops looking for permissions when it finds the first Group that matches, so if one line gives everyone access to everything, a later line will NOT be able to take that access away. Be very careful.</I

>If a user is a member of 2 or more Groups, the Groups are evaluated in the order they are listed in Administration -&#62; Permissions.
</P
><P
>Example: The user is put into two Groups: "GroupA" and "GroupB". GroupA has explicit access to a particular feature. GroupB explicitly does NOT have access to that feature. Since GroupA is evaluated first, the user will have access to that particular feature.
