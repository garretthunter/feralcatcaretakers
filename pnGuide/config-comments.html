>Comments allow users to interact with your website. When a user reads a News article on your site, if they feel that they have something to add to the article -- a point of clarification, a correction, or anything else -- they may post a comment with that information. These comments are stored in the web site database, and are displayed at the bottom of the page whenever the article is read.
</P

>This configuration option for Comments determines how user comments on News articles will be handled by PostNuke.

>Type of moderation: This setting determines the type of moderation you want for Comments on your site. Moderation may be necessary because sometimes users will post inappropriate or off-topic information in their comments. Be aware that excessive moderation can kill a community. Moderators have the ability to edit or remove comments from your site. Select the type of moderation you want from the options. The site Administrator always has full moderation rights over all comments, no matter the setting below.

>"Moderation by Admin": This is the most common configuration for a site run by one person. The site Administrator has full moderation rights over all comments, and they may delete inappropriate comments as they see fit.

>"Moderation by users": With this option set, your registered, logged-in users have full moderation rights over all comments, and they may delete inappropriate comments as they see fit. This is useful in a "community" web site.

>"No moderation": No moderation at all. Only the site Administrator has full moderation rights over all comments.

>Allow Anonymous to post?: This setting determines if Anonymous users may post comments. If set to "Yes", all users may post comments. If set to "No", only registered, logged-in users may post comments. Entry example: "No"
</P

><LI
><P
>Comments limit in bytes: This determines the total size, in bytes, of a posted comment. This setting is here to prevent users from "flooding" your system with random text to try and cause errors in your database. The default setting is a very good choice -- 4096. This allows for a fairly sizable comment, but does not endanger the system.

>Anonymous default name: The default name for non-registered users on your site as displayed in the Comments. Entry example: "Anonymous".
