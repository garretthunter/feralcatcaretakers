This page will show you who has been linking to your site.<br><br>

This list tends to get large quite fast, so you might want to delete them often. You
can also deactivate this feature in the site <i>Preferences</i>.<br><br>

You can delete the referers when you want by clicking on the <i>Delete Referrers</i> button, or you can
setup a maximum number of referrers in the site <i>Preferences</i>.<br><br>
